This project popped up [in my Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/pglevy/status/1466877632629329927) this past week, and I'm geeking out about it. [GH CMS](https://github.com/oscarnevarezleal/gh-cms) uses slick automation (via GitHub Actions) and built-in, web-based features like Issues and Pages to auto-magically generate a blog-style site.

Here's what you do to get it up and running:

1. Go to the repo and create your own copy using the  button (upper right corner).
2. Go the  section of the  tab and enable the  feature.
3. Go to the  section of the  tab and set the source to the branch  and press . (It will take a few minutes before the site is published.)
4. Go to the  tab and create a new issue.

Notes:

- You need to enable Actions on forked projects.
